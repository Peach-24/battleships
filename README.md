# Battleships 🚢 💣 💥

___

### Brief

The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships (video). Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

- 1x Battleship (5 squares)
- 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”, where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.

- Implement a scoring system that rewards those who sink all enemy ships in the fewest moves.
- Leaderboard for above scores - user inputs their name for the leaderboard at the beginning of the game.
- Multiplayer
